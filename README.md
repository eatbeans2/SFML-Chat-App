# SFML-Chat-App
Experiments with networking and SFML to create a chat app

Included is a makefile for compiling, a host app, a client app, and some code for the GUI shared mutually between them.
Making this run may require changing the location of SFML in the makefile
Additionally, one can change the IP settings in the host file.

Features to add:
Choosing username
Officially test hosting outside local network
Scrolling up to old messages
Detect and handle multi-line messages (should be easy)
Multiple clients?
